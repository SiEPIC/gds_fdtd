Architecture Overview
=====================

This page provides a short description of the main modules in
``gds_fdtd`` and how they interact to build FDTD simulations.

``core``
    Core data structures and helper functions used throughout the
    package.  It defines geometrical primitives, ports and utilities
    used by all backends.

``lyprocessor``
    Utilities for parsing and processing GDS files with
    :mod:`klayout`.  These helpers convert layouts into the internal
    data structures defined in ``core``.

``lum_tools`` and ``t3d_tools``
    Interfaces to the Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D solvers respectively.
    They translate the structures generated by ``lyprocessor`` into
    solver specific objects and run the simulations.

``simprocessor``
    Higher level routines to assemble complete simulations from a
    technology description and extracted layout information.

The examples shipped with the repository demonstrate how these modules
are combined to create, run and analyse simulations.
