Welcome to gds_fdtd's documentation!
=====================================

``gds_fdtd`` is a minimal Python module for setting up FDTD simulations on planar nanophotonic devices using solvers like Tidy3D and Lumerical.

**Key Features:**
- Modular FDTD solver architecture (Tidy3D, Lumerical)  
- Multi-modal electromagnetic simulations (TE/TM modes)
- Comprehensive S-parameter analysis and export
- Enhanced field visualization and logging
- YAML-based technology configuration
- GDS layout integration with automatic port detection
