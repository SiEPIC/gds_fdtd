Minimal Python module to assist in setting up Tidy3D FDTD simulation on planar nanophotonic devices.


Features
--------
* Generate tidy3d simulation of a gds device systematically.
* Generate tidy3d simulations from GDS device by identifying ports and simulation region from an input technology stack.
* Generate S-parameters of devices and export them to standard formats.

Installation
--------
.. code-block:: bash
