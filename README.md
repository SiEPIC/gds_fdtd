**gds_fdtd** is a minimal Python module to assist in setting up FDTD simulations for planar nanophotonic devices using FDTD solvers such as Tidy3D.

## Features

- **Automated FDTD Setup:** Easily set up Lumerical and Tidy3D simulations for devices designed in GDS.
- **Integration with SiEPIC:** Generate FDTD simulations directly from components defined in [SiEPIC](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC-Tools) EDA and it's associated PDKs (e.g., [SiEPIC-EBeam-PDK](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK)).
- **Integration with gdsfactory:** Generate Tidy3D simulations directly from [gdsfactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory) designs by identifying ports and simulation regions from an input technology stack.
- **S-Parameter Extraction:** Automatically generate and export S-parameters of your photonic devices in standard formats.
- **Multimode/Dual Polarization Simulations:** Set up simulations that support multimode or dual polarization configurations for advanced device analysis.

## Installation

You can install `gds_fdtd` using the following options:

### Quick install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install gds_fdtd
```

### Option: Basic Installation from source

To install the core functionality of `gds_fdtd`, clone the repository and install using `pip`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mustafacc/gds_fdtd.git
cd gds_fdtd
pip install -e .
```

### Option: Development Installation

For contributing to the development or if you need testing utilities, install with the dev dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mustafacc/gds_fdtd.git
cd gds_fdtd
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This will install additional tools like `pytest` and `coverage` for testing.

### Editable + dev tools

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
